# Rate-Limit-Checker
Simulates an email spoofing attack by sending form submissions to a target website's endpoint. Uses 2Captcha service to automatically solve reCAPTCHA challenges, encodes target email addresses in Base64, and sends spoofed email requests. A GUI built with tkinter allows you to input parameters, control the process, and view real-time logs.
